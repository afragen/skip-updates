A plugin that allows for adding installed dot org hosted plugins or themes to skip updating.

## Description

Have you ever had a custom plugin or theme accidentally overwritten by an update from a wp.org plugin or theme with an identical slug? There are several very old Trac tickets describing this behavior and are still waiting for a solution in core. That solution is now available.

This is a plugin that will add a Settings menu, **Skip Updates**, where plugins or themes may be added by selecting the plugin or theme from the dropdown. Once added, the plugin or theme will **no longer receive updates or update notices from wp.org**.

Only plugins or themes on wp.org are displayed for selection.

This does require that this plugin is installed and activated for this protection. Fortunately there is a [plugin dependency installer](https://github.com/afragen/wp-dependency-installer) library that may be added to your plugin or theme that is able to install and activate any plugin, including this one, in either an optional or mandatory fashion.

## Development
PRs are welcome against the `develop` branch.
